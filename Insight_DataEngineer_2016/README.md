# Insight_DataScience-Project
Clean Tweet text and calculate tweet degrees
1- I just tried to made project tree as much as possible similar to project description. but I am thinking it is not clear and understandable.

2- this project will read file tweet.txt from this path: ..\\insight_testsuite\tests\test-2-tweets-all-distinct\\tweet_input\tweets.txt"

3- the output will be available on this path too: @"..\\insight_testsuite\tests\test-2-tweets-all-distinct\\tweet_output\\output.txt"

4- you can run the program directly from this path: ..\\src\Run\InsightDataScience.exe

5- you can open the project and build it again by giving new input and output address on TextExtraction.cs class

6- just download the project and go to the src/Run and run the InsightDataScience.exe

7- if you want to see my project on Visual Studio and run it, you need NewtonSoft.Json which is a dll file and you can easily download it by NuGet.

8- One Sample of the output already is located on tweet_output folder
